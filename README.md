This repository contains a simple C program that exhibits an uncommon error related to pointer arithmetic.  The core issue lies in how the program modifies a value using a pointer. While the code appears functional at first glance, it carries a risk of unexpected behavior or crashes depending on factors like compiler optimization and system architecture. The bug and solution files provide both an example of the erroneous code and its correct counterpart.  This example is useful in demonstrating subtle pointer-related issues in C that can be difficult to debug.
